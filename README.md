# IceCreamStore

Role-Based Activity Guidelines
Your team has been asked to implement a RESTful API for a web application called “Ice
Cream” for a local ice cream company, where:

• Ice cream flavors change monthly, and only the top five flavors from the previous
month remain on the menu.

• There are 25 flavors on the menu per month.

• The most popular flavors are determined through customer voting and customer
buying patterns.

• The company needs to be able to get the customer purchasing information,
customer voting information, the menu for each month, and all flavors.

• Customers must be able to vote each month, see their user profile, and view
their purchasing history.

Your team will design the API and provide a service to implement the API. (A separate team
will handle the data storage).
Some of the constraints:

• The full menu of ice cream flavors can contain no more than 125 flavors.

• Each customer may place five votes per month, and they cannot vote for any
flavor more than once.

**As the RESTful API designer, you must:**

• List the major endpoints you will need to provide.

• Include the key components of the request payloads and response bodies for
each endpoint.

• Optionally, indicate any other related aspects of the design and implementation.
You may use PowerPoint slides, working code, or a research document as a presentation
aid. Please allow 15-20 minutes at the end for Q&A.
